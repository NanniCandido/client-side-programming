## 📦 Assignment 2

### 🧪 Topics Covered:
- JavaScript fundamentals (functions, objects, arrays)
- Working with public APIs (JSON)
- DOM manipulation
- Application architecture with IIFE
- Game logic: Poker hand detection

### 🃏 Project Highlights:
- **Part B**: Fetched and displayed data from a public API using `document.write` and structured DOM manipulation.
- **Part C**: Built a Poker Hand Analyzer:
  - Used the **Deck of Cards API** to draw and display 5 cards
  - Implemented logic to detect the **highest poker hand**
  - Ensured encapsulation using an **IIFE pattern**
  
📎 Technologies: JavaScript, AJAX (Fetch), DOM API

## 🗺️ Assignment 3

### 🧪 Topics Covered:
- Functional programming with `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`
- Geospatial visualization with **Leaflet.js**
- API integration and data transformation into **GeoJSON**
- Real-time data refresh with custom markers

### 🚍 Transit Tracker Project:
- Displayed real-time **bus** or **flight** data on an interactive Leaflet map
- Used public APIs filtered by:
  - Canadian flights *(OpenSky Network)* or
  - HRM buses *(Halifax Transit)*
- Converted data to **GeoJSON** format
- Plotted vehicles as **custom icons** on the map
- Implemented **auto-refresh** without reloading the page

📎 Technologies: JavaScript, Leaflet.js, GeoJSON, Fetch API, Custom Icons

## 📊 Assignment 5

### 🧪 Topics Covered:
- Responsive charting with **billboard.js** and **D3.js**
- Functional data transformation (no loops)
- Dynamic, delayed-loaded data visualization
- Separation of logic using IIFE and unobtrusive JavaScript

### 📺 Friends API + Custom API Charts:
- Used the **TV Maze API** to visualize episode and cast data from the TV show *Friends*
- Created 5+ custom charts including:
  - Bar charts, pie charts, time series (with delay-loaded data)
- Fetched and processed external JSON data from a second public API (custom choice)
- Ensured all logic was encapsulated in an IIFE and followed clean code practices

📎 Technologies: JavaScript, billboard.js, D3.js, Friends API, Custom API, SASS

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Applied real-world JS use cases: data retrieval, transformation, visualization
- Built complete browser-based applications with **no global scope pollution**
- Leveraged **public APIs** for live data processing
- Emphasized **functional array methods** over loops
- Practiced **modular**, maintainable code design
